// Real e-AMUSEMENT card readers on the PC: a card held to one is that player's card in the game
// (Core::card_read: pop'n music 9-14, and GuitarFreaks and DrumMania with their card units), and a
// reader's 10-key is the game's ("Keypad 0".., "P2 Keypad 0".. for player 2's). Each reader runs on
// a thread of its own; readers_frame() hands the core what they read, once a frame, on its thread.
//
//   --reader PATH   a Konami e-AMUSEMENT reader with its 10-key (the ICCA/ICCB/ICCC family that
//                   spice2x's -reader drives) on a serial port: a USB-serial adapter, /dev/ttyUSB0,
//                   or better its /dev/serial/by-id/ name. Given twice, the second is player 2's
//                   (--reader "" --reader PATH: player 2's only)
//   --scard         NFC readers (ACR122U and the like) through PC/SC (the pcscd service): the first
//                   reader listed is player 1's, the second player 2's
//   --cardio        cardio readers (USB HID, usage page 0xffca) through /dev/hidraw*: likewise
//
// A card's number is its 16 hex digits. One that isn't an e-AMUSEMENT PASS (E004...; a FeliCa
// card, a phone) is made one as spice2x's -scardfix does: E00401 and its first 5 bytes, since
// these games know only those. A card held there stays read for 3 s (the reader sees it again
// and again).
