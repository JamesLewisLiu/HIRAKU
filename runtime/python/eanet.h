// The network a Python 1 cabinet's e-AMUSEMENT sees, inside HIRAKU: no host sockets of its own.
// The interface board has the network port, and the game (through the IOP) sends it BSD-style
// socket commands on channels 0-7 (PLAN.md section 23, "e-AMUSEMENT"). This answers them as
// a small LAN would:
//   - the board's addresses: 192.168.50.2/24, gateway and DNS 192.168.50.1;
//   - DNS (UDP 53): "services..." is 192.168.50.1; any other name gets an address of its own
//     on the LAN (192.168.50.10 on), remembered, so a connection to it names its host again;
//   - UDP to 192.168.50.1 at Lobby::PORT: NET TAISEN's lobby (pop'n 12-14, lobby.h), answered at
//     once; datagrams to other cabinets and broadcasts go on the LAN cable to cabinets in other
//     processes (lancable.h: then this cabinet is 192.168.50.2 + its number, and only the
//     first cabinet keeps the lobby), else nowhere, as on a LAN with no other cabinet. A recvfrom
//     waits for its socket's timeout (in whole frames), as the board's;
//   - TCP: each HTTP request the game sends goes to a handler, with the host and port it
//     connected to (docs/EAMUSE3.md). The handler answers at once (the server in the core:
//     reproducible) or later (a real server on the network); a recv waits for the answer, as
//     the board's does.
// Board commands (the game's RPC number + 1): 0b socket, 0c bind, 0d listen, 0e accept,
// 0f connect, 13 setsockopt, 14 send, 15 sendto, 16 recv, 17 recvfrom, 1c shutdown,
// 1d close, 1e a board property. The rest (start-up, DHCP, the machine id) stay the
// emulator's.
