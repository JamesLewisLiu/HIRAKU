// The shop's LAN between Python cabinets in separate HIRAKU processes, for NET TAISEN (pop'n
// 12-14; docs/EAMUSE3.md). Each process is one cabinet with its own address on 192.168.50.0/24
// (the host .2, the guests .3 on); the cable carries the UDP datagrams their games send to each
// other, the lobby's (the host keeps the lobby) and broadcasts.
//
// The cabinets run in lockstep, a frame at a time: at each frame's end every side hands over the
// datagrams its game sent during the frame and takes everyone else's, which its game finds at
// the start of the next. So a battle replays the same on any host, however its processes are
// scheduled, and either side may run faster than real time; a datagram takes one frame (16.7 ms),
// about what a shop's LAN plus the cabinets' polling took.
//
// It is a star: the host listens at a Unix socket (a path) or TCP (host:port) and waits for all
// its guests; each guest connects (trying for up to ten minutes). Each frame the guests send
// their datagrams to the host, which sends everyone all of them. If a side quits, the cable goes
// idle for the others.
