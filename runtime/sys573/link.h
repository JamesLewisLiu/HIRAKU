// The session cable between two System 573 processes: a GuitarFreaks cabinet's SIO1 on one of
// the DrumMania cabinet's multi-session unit's ports (as windyfairy's fork joins two MAMEs with a
// null modem: msu_port2 to the GuitarFreaks' rs232_network). Each process is one cabinet, with
// its own game and recompiled code.
//
// The same cable joins a club kit's two cabinets (docs/CATALOGUE.md, Phase 6): a DDR 2nd Club
// Version 573's SIO1 to a Twinkle's network port (runtime/twinkle/board.cpp: Club Version 1's
// super I/O 16550, Club Version 2's SIO1). Either side's UART is on the far side's line levels as
// it would be on a wire: a 16550 samples TXD by its own bit clock, the fork's SIO1 takes a bit per
// call, and both send a call per bit.
//
// The cable carries line levels (TXD, DTR, RTS each way), stamped with the sender's emulated
// time, so the far UART gets the bits as it would on a wire: TXD as the sending UART's bit clock
// drives it, once a bit (the fork's SIO1 counts calls, not time), DTR and RTS when they change.
// The two machines run in lockstep: every `quantum` of emulated time each side sends what changed
// and waits for the other to get there too, and a change takes effect on the far side one
// quantum after it happened (a cable one quantum long). So a session replays the same on any host, however its processes are
// scheduled, and either side may run faster than real time.
//
// It also carries sound: the host's multi-session unit plays the session's music, and a real
// unit sends it to each cabinet's amplifier (a sub board per port, with its own DAC), so the
// host sends the unit's mix along with its steps and the other cabinet plays it too. In a club
// session the IIDX cabinet plays the music (the fork's notes), so the Twinkle sends its mix.
//
// Transport: a Unix socket (a path) or TCP (host:port). The host (the side with the unit)
// listens and waits; the other connects. If the far side quits, the cable goes idle.
